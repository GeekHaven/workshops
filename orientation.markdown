# the format

Some days there will be a workshop scheduled.
Workshops will take at most an hour or two.

The rest of the day, you should work on your own
projects.

Facilitators will be around to help and you can
ask fellow students for help. We're all learners!

# you'll need a unix

All of our course materials assume a unixy
environment such as MaxOSX or Linux.

Why unix?

* all the system tools fit together consistently
* most programming answers you'll find on the
  internet assume a unix environment
* open source programmers mostly use unix,
  so the best libraries and tools run there

# if you're on windows

First of all, you should install Linux!

Two three ways to run linux from windows:

* in a virtual machine (like virtualbox)
* dual boot
* blow away windows completely

---

# virtualbox

Run an ordinary program that runs linux.

https://www.virtualbox.org/

## pros:

* can run windows and linux at the same time

## cons:

* can use up a lot of memory
* clunkier to juggle local versus VM

---

# dual boot

You can install linux alongside windows on your
system by dual booting.

When you boot your system you can choose which
operating system to boot into.

Regular linux installers can set up a dual boot.

---

# blow away windows

Do you just want to completely remove windows and
all the files on your hard disk? 

When you install linux with an installer,
just blow away windows!

---

# if you're on MacOSX

If you are on MacOSX you already have a suitable
UNIX environment.

However, particularly if you have an older version
of MacOSX, it can be difficult to configure an OSX
environment properly.

You might need to install xcode just to get a
decent C compiler, for example.

As a backup, you can also install virtualbox on
your MacOSX computer and run linux in a VM:
