# workshops

This repository contains lecture notes for all the cyberwizard institute
workshops:

* [unix](unix.markdown) - learn the history and motivations behind unix along
with a hands-on introduction to the command-line and bash!

* [UI](ui.markdown) - Consider for a moment what goes on in the mind of the people visiting your web site or app. How much effort are they willing to exert to: 1) know they're in the right place, 2) find what they're looking for, 3) know how to respond?
