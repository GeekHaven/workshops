# Web Page UI: Don't Make Me Think 
(much about your interface)

### INTRODUCTION

Likely most developers spend some amount of time concerning themselves with the time it takes a page or view to load in the browser. But what about the time it takes the the *interface* to "load" in the user's brain? It's apparent too long a delay for the necessary elements to load on the page results in a higher bail rate, however the task of delivering the contents is not complete until the user can make sense it.

Touching on some big picture concerns
- Site design
  - Page/View diagram
- Getting from A to B
  - Load -> Present (Persuade or provide tools) -> Call to Action(s)
  - Cognitive Load
- Page/View Components
  - Site ID
  - Page Title
  - Primary content/functions
  - Navigation

### PRINCIPLES to Reduce Cognitive Load:

- Grouping
- Consistency
  - Grammatical type (nouns, verbs, phrases)
  - Person (first person, second person)
- Priority (left/right, top/bottom, emphasis)
- Scan-ability (structured text, spacing, proximity)
- Meaningful Icons (learning types, recollection on return)
- Color Coding

### BENEFITS of Cognitive Load Reduction
- Pre-process information, my 1 hour can save others many hours scratching their heads
- Increase persistence, retention 
- Increase desired response
