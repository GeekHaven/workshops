# javascript

javascript is a programming language
you can use to program web pages
and command-line tools and servers

---

# install node

We'll be using node on the command-line
to learn javascript.

Download and install node from:

https://nodejs.org

---

# write a program

Now let's make a program. Put this text
into a file called robot.js:

``` js
console.log('BEEP BOOP')
```

---

# run a program

Now use `node` to run your program:

```
$ node robot.js
BEEP BOOP
```

---

# recap: console.log

`console.log(...)` is a function that
prints its arguments to stdout followed
by a newline (`\n`) character

---

# recap: 'BEEP BOOP'

* `'BEEP BOOP'` is a string.
* `'BEEP BOOP'` is an argument
  to the `console.log()` function.

Note the single quotes on each side.

You can use double quotes too: `"BEEP BOOP"`

Sometimes an "argument" is called a "parameter".

---

# statements

In the previous program, we had a single
statement. You can have multiple statements,
each on their own line:

``` js
console.log('Such')
console.log('wow.')
```

Now save this code to a file `suchwow.js`
and run it with `node`:

```
$ node suchwow.js
Such
wow.
```

---

# statements

You might also see programs that use
semicolons to separate statements:

``` js
console.log('Such');
console.log('wow.');
```

Semicolons are optional. There are some
cases where they are necessary, but this
is rare in practice. 

Both including and omitting semicolons
are popular code styles.

---

# variables

Another kind of statement is a variable
declaration:

``` js
var x = 5
var y = 111
console.log(x * y)

var a = 'beep'
var b = 'boop'
console.log(a + b)
```

which prints:

```
$ node vars.js
555
beepboop
```

---

# variables

Variables are containers that can hold values.

Strings like `'beep'` and numbers like `5`
are values.

---

# operators

We used the `*` operator to multiply
two numbers.

Here are some other operators you can try with
numbers:

* `+` - add
* `-` - subtract
* `*` - multiply
* `/` - divide
* `%` - modulo (the remainder after division)

modulo is really handy when you need a value
to "wrap around"

---

# assignment updates

You can change the value stored in a variable
at any time by assigning a new value.

``` js
var x = 5;
x = x + 10;
console.log(x);
```

which prints `15`:

```
$ node x.js
15
```

---

# assignment operators

There is a shorthand for running an operator
and saving the result back to a variable.
Instead of `x = x + 10` we can do
`x += 10` instead:

``` js
var x = 5
x += 10
console.log(x)
```

Just take one of the arithmetic operators
from earlier and add an `=` at the end to
do an update "in place":

* `+=` - add in place
* `-=` - subtract in place
* `*=` - multiply in place
* `/=` - divide in place
* `%=` - modulo in place

---

# increment, decrement

There are two other operators for convenience:

* `x++` - increment x by 1 in place
Same as: `x += 1` or `x = x + 1`

* `x--` - decrement x by 1 in place
Same as: `x += 1` or `x = x + 1`

You might also see `++x` and `--x` which
are similar to `x++` and `x--` but have
slightly different uses. More on them later.

---

# booleans

`true` or `false`

---

# comparison operators

The comparison operators all return a boolean:

* `===` - strict equality
* `!==` - not strict equality
* `<` - less than
* `<=` - less than or equal to
* `>` - greater than
* `>=` - greater than or equal to

You might also see coercive equality operators:

* `==` - coercive equality
* `!=` - not coercive equality

but you should avoid these operators until
learning about type coercion.

---

# comparison operators: example

```
var x = 5;
console.log(x < 6);
console.log(x === 2);
console.log(x !== 5);
console.log(x >= 5);
```

output:

```
$ node cmp.js
true
false
false
true
```

---

# logical operators

* `&&` - AND
* `||` - OR
* `!` - NOT (the opposite truth value)

`!` is a "unary" operator like `++` and `--`
because it binds to a single value.

`&&` and `||` are "binary" operators
because they bind to two values:
one on the left and one on the right.

---

# logical operators: example

``` js
var x = true
var y = false
console.log(x && y) // false
console.log(x || y) // true
console.log(!(x || y)) // false
console.log(!y) // true
```

outputs:

```
$ node bool.js
false
true
false
true
```

# comments

By the way, `//` is the comment operator.
Anything that follows `//` on a line is
ignored by the computer.

You can even have whole blocks of comments
by putting text between `/*` and `*/`:

``` js
// this is a comment
console.log('beep boop'); // wow
/*
  and this is a comment that
  spans multiple
  lines
*/
```

---

# if

You can make a block of code execute when
a conditional expression is true using an
`if` statement.

The conditional expression is the expression
surrounded by parenethesis following the word
`if`:

``` js
var x = 5;
if (x < 10) {
    console.log('wow');
}
```

this program will print:

```
$ node if.js
wow
```

but if we change the program to be:

``` js
var x = 11;
if (x < 10) {
    console.log('wow');
}
```

then it won't print anything since the
conditional expression evaluated to false:

```
$ node if.js
```

---

# else

You can put an `else` statement after an
`if` statement to tell the computer what
to do if the `if` conditional expression
wasn't true:

``` js
var x = 11;
if (x < 10) {
    console.log('wow');
}
else {
    console.log('cool');
}
```

will print:

```
$ node else.js
cool
```

---

# else if

---

# nesting conditionals

---

# indentation

Now is a good time to talk about indentation.

---

# arrays

Arrays are ordered lists of values.
You can make an array with square brackets:

``` js
var arr = [ 3, 2, 5 ]
console.log(arr)
```

---

# arrays: push

To add an item to the end of an array,
use `arr.push()`:

``` js
var arr = [ 8, 1 ];
arr.push(5);
console.log(arr);
```

prints:

```
[ 8, 1, 5 ]
```

`arr.push()` is an example of a builtin
method, a function you can call that has
been defined by the language itself.

Later we'll see how to inspect what
methods are available.

---

# arrays: pop

You can also remove an element from the
end of an array with `arr.pop()`:

``` js
```

---

# arrays: shift and unshift

---

# arrays: slice

---

# arrays: splice

---

# objects

We've already been using some objects:

* `process` is an object with a property
`argv` that is an array.
* `console` is an object with a property
`log` that is a function.
